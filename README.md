MPI and Diameter of Graph
-------------------------
This project experiment MPI programming for computing the diameter of a graph. The objective is to achieve the maximum speedup possible.

This assignment work is done for COMP90025 Project 1D assessment 2016 SM2, The University of Melbourne. You can read [the report](SanKhoLin_829463_COMP90025_Project1D_Report.pdf). You may also want to read the related [`openmp-graph-diameter`](https://github.com/victorskl/openmp-graph-diameter) assignment. The implementation still has room for improvement. You may wish to cite this work as follow.
